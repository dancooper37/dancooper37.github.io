<h3> Could Protein Based Materials Be Part Of The Next Industrial Revolution? </h3>
<p> Over the course of millennia, humans have exploited naturally occurring protein-based materials for properties such as strength, warmth and aesthetic appeal. Such materials continue to be manufactured from both animal and plant-derived proteins on an industrial scale (Abascal and Regan, 2018). Today, with our still-advancing understanding of protein structure, function and synthesis we are able to utilise the innate programmability of the genetic code to produce synthetic recombinant protein-based materials and composites (Silva et al., 2014).  Herein I aim to outline the emerging methods, applications and potential for these materials to have revolutionary effect.</p>
<p> Protein-based materials have a number of key features, in comparison to synthetic plastics and non-protein materials, that interest contemporary research: biodegradability, biocompatibility, renewability, and modularity (Abascal and Regan, 2018). Many of these proteins are currently harvested from both food and non-food crops, such as soybeans which can be refined into soy protein isolate (SPI) (Silva et al., 2014). Other proteins; however, must be harvested from animals. These highly unscalable methods rely on, or result in, the death of the animals in the process, whilst producing materials that exhibit great disparity in composition and polymer chain length (Lin and Liu, 2016). In the case of collagen and elastin, production relies on waste bovine and porcine tissues from the meat industry, while the harvesting of silk from the cocoons of B. mori results in their death (Abascal and Regan, 2018). For this reason, synthetically manufactured alternatives are required if protein-based materials are to become more established.</p>
<p> Synthetic protein-based materials can be manufactured in multiple ways, but the methods currently receiving the most attention involve recombinant host organism “factories” that provide a sustainable, scalable, and economical source of proteins. Foong et al., (2020) describe their development of a recombinant marine photosynthetic bacterium capable of producing spidroin, the primary constituent of spider silk, which has previously been notoriously difficult to cultivate due to spiders’ territorial and predatory behaviour, while demonstrating far superior qualities in comparison to conventional silks. Certain spiders are also able to produce multiple types of silk with varying mechanical and biological properties by modifying specific repeating sequences within the constituent proteins (Silva et al., 2014). </p>
<p> The intrinsic modularity of proteins in relation to both their primary, and macroscopic structures is a key aspect that may be critical in allowing protein-based materials to be used across multiple industries. In their review, Lin and Liu (2016) describe how modular protein domains can be used to adapt the properties of materials. Five distinct domain functions were identified: structural, responsive, crosslinking, bioactive and degradable, which can be integrated into existing protein-based materials or composites, or used to design novel materials with precise structure and behaviour.  </p>
<p> An example of the real-world possibilities of these modular, highly editable protein-based materials is in the field of biomedical engineering. Elastin and collagen are both highly abundant in mammalian tissues, and so are excellent starting proteins to modify in order to create reparatory grafts and scaffolds. Hsueh et al., (2014) synthesised three elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), each with amino acid substitutions in the repeating units to confer a different function. The three ELPs, tailored to improve biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and cell adhesion, were cross linked into a membrane with glutaraldehyde. This material was found to be an ideal scaffold for use in the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). Similar results were shown by Han et al., (2011) using a composite material of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), elastin and gelatine – producing a fibrous scaffold suitable for vascular grafts because of it’s high tensile strength and intrinsic compatibility and adhesion to the native endothelium. </p>
<p> Another example of an application that has the potential for revolutionary effect is the use of composite, bioactive, and degradable packaging materials. The packaging industry is the largest consumer of single-use, non-renewable synthetic plastics (Geyer et al., 2017). As more attention is given to reducing the use of synthetic plastics because of the negative environmental effects of plastics pollution, as well as the shortening supplies of fossil fuels, protein-based materials may be the best solution. González and Igarzabal (2013, as cited by Silva et al., 2014) demonstrated the preparation of a composite poly(lactic acid) / soy protein isolate (PLA / SPI) film which integrated active antimicrobial agents without modifying the surface of the material chemically. The inclusion of the antimicrobial agents within the structure inhibited the growth of yeasts, mould and the bacterial species susceptible to the antimicrobial agents. SPI is a particularly interesting type of plant-derived protein in terms of industrial usage; until the late 1940’s soy protein (SP) was utilised to elaborate existing industrial materials, in a similar way to how petroleum products would later be used, until the price of crude oil (due to the widespread adoption of synthetic plastics) made it economically unviable (Silva et al., 2014).</p>
<p> In conclusion, I believe that protein-based materials could be part of the next industrial revolution. The previous three revolutions have been characterised by technologies that transformed almost every industry, such as steam power in the first industrial revolution, and the microprocessor in the third industrial revolution. In each of these revolutions, new technologies quickly made previous ones obsolete (Magal and Ward, 2019). As the need to replace synthetic plastics products becomes greater, protein-based materials could become the ideal material, as I have mentioned previously. Protein-based materials used for biomedical engineering could eclipse contemporary treatments, and theoretically improve countless lives. Protein nanotechnology is still an emerging field, with unknown but widespread applications (Gerrard, 2013), and protein-based microelectronics are becoming feasible (Ron et al., 2010). These examples suggest to me that protein-based materials have such widespread potential, across multiple industries to have revolutionary potential, in line with previous revolutionary technologies. </p>
