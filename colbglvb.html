<h3> Construction of λ Bacteriophage Genomic Library via BamHI / Sau3A Restriction </h3>
<p> Enterobacteria phage λ is a E. coli bacteriophage, a highly studied molecular genetics tool for it’s genomic integration ability and life-cycle. The 48kbp genome of λ contains 116 Sau3A restriction sites, producing a maximal fragment length of 2kbp. Sau3A digestion produces BamHI-compatible cohesive ends, permitting insertion into a pUC18 plasmid multiple cloning site (MCS). Herein we investigate whether Sau3A and BamHI restriction endonucleases can effectively clone a λ phage genomic library for sequencing.</p>
<p> pUC18 vector plasmids were linearised by BamHI digestion, and λ phage was fragmented by Sau3A to produce inserts with compatible cohesive ends. Ligation of the vector and insert digests formed recombinant pUC18-λ plasmids. Restriction digest and ligation performance was then verified by gel electrophoresis analysis, against controls. Recombinant pUC18 plasmids, carrying λ fragments were transformed by heat-shock into competent DH5α E. coli cells, and cultured on CIX agar against controls. White colonies were isolated and amplified before electrophoresis to observe λ fragment variation.</p>
<p> BamHI-digested pUC18 ran slower than undigested controls, while Sau3A-digested λ phage ran significantly faster and was smeared over 2kbp relative to the control. The vector-insert ligation band was smeared and ran slower than the vector self-ligation control band. Culturing of the transformed DH5α cells produced white colonies, while undigested DH5α-pUC18 controls formed blue colonies. Visualisation of the individual white colonies, after PCR amplification, displayed recombinant plasmids of sizes 0-2kbp greater than DH5α-pUC18 controls.</p>
<p> Digest visualisation indicated successful λ fragmentation and pUC18 linearisation, with λ fragment sizes consistent with calculated Sau3A restriction sites. White colony growth by transformed DH5α cells indicated successful vector-insert ligation, having disrupted the pUC18 MCS-spanning LacZ gene. Our colony PCR gel showed successful ligation of multiple insert fragment sizes consistent with expected Sau3A restriction sites, indicating successful cloning of the λ genome. We conclude that restriction endonucleases BamHI / Sau3A are effective in cloning a λ phage genomic library, ready for sequencing.</p>
